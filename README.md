# ECO 394D: Probability and Statistics


### What is this course about?

This class is about gaining knowledge from data and about understanding random phenomena.  We'll cover a mix of practice and principles:  
- You'll learn the mathematical foundations of probability, the language for expressing judgments about uncertain outcomes.  
- You'll gain a solid understanding of some essential statistical ideas: estimation, hypothesis testing, regression, and a few others.  
- You'll learn some concrete data-crunching skills, using the [R language](https://www.rstudio.com/).    

There's also an important short-term goal: prep you for Econometrics this upcoming academic year.
