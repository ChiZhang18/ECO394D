## Problem 1

Download the data in `creatinine.csv` from the course website.  Each row is a patient in a doctor's office. 
- age: patient's age in years.  
- creatclear: patient's creatine clearance rate in mL/minute, a measure of kidney health (higher is better).  

Use this data, together with your knowledge of linear regression, to answer three questions:    
  1. What creatinine clearance rate should we expect, on average, for a 55-year-old?  
  2. How does creatinine clearance rate change with age?   
  3. Whose creatinine clearance rate is healthier (higher) for their age: a 40-year-old with a rate of 135, or a 60-year-old with a rate of 112?
