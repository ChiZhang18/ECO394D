# Course materials and software  

## Readings

There are no required textbooks to buy.  I will post my slides for all course materials below.  Readings are drawn from the following free sources:  
- [Introduction to Probability](./ref/Bertsekas_Tsitsiklis_Introduction_to_probability.pdf), by Dimitri P. Bertsekas and John N. Tsitsiklis.  
- [Data Science: A Gentle Introduction](./ref/DataScience.pdf), some of my own course notes covering various topics in data analysis and regression.   

We will not cover these two references in their entirety, so I will call your attention to which sections are relevant to which parts of the course in the outline below.  

I will also draw some of my own lecture materials from Larry Wasserman's [All of Statistics.](https://www.amazon.com/All-Statistics-Statistical-Inference-Springer/dp/1441923225)  This is _not required_: I will not assign any homework problems or readings from it.  However, if you intend on pursuing further graduate studies and wanted a single reference on your bookshelf that covers a wide range of topics in probability and statistical inference, this would be my recommendation.  


## Software

Please install [R](http://www.r-project.org) and then [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.org) on your own computer (you want the "RStudio Desktop" version).  Both are free and work on all platforms.    

R is the underlying data-analysis program we'll use in this course, while RStudio provides a nice front-end interface to R that makes certain repetitive steps (e.g. loading data, saving plots) very simple.   We will use RStudio a little bit in the beginning of the course, and a lot more towards the middle and end.  RStudio depends upon having R available behind the scenes, so make sure you install both, even though you won't need to interact directly with the R program itself.    

In addition to R, there will be a few occasions where we'll work with very simple spreadsheets.  Basically any program will work here -- I'll use [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/).
